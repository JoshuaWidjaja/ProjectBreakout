# ProjectBreakout

My version of the famous Atari game, "Breakout". Implemented in Python using the Pygame Library.

BreakoutV3 - Official version, utilizes one main file and 3 helper class files to allow game functionality. Also utilizes pygame.sprite and pygame.sprite.group to allow
more efficient code and game display.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BreakoutV1 and V2 are older versions, V1 doesn't have helper classes and V2 doesn't utilize Pygame.sprite to effectively display the game.
